## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and FastAPI as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
